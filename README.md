# Expenses_Tracker_FrontEnd

This HTML document creates a simple expenses tracker application using AngularJS. The user can input their salary, add expenses with names, amounts, and dates, and filter these expenses by month and year. The application displays the total expenses and calculates the remaining balance after accounting for the expenses. The user can also delete individual expense entries, and the interface updates dynamically to reflect these changes.
